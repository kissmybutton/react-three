#Description
Our client is an architectural company that creates modern 3D models for its clients. They want to have an online tool where they can load 3D models, present them in a scene and have the ability to rotate them and move them in the 3d space. They want to have users that will have restricted access to the platform as editors and users that will have full control over the platform as visitors.

As a first step, we will create the structure of the platform and the proof of concept for the rotation and movement of an imported 3d object imported into the scene.
